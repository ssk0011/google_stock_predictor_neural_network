# google_stock_predictor_neural_network

Implementing a deep learning neural network with Tensorflow and Kerastuner to optimize an LSTM model. The application is for predicting Google stock prices for 2023, based on data from the following dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alirezajavid1999/google-stock-2010-2023

The model uses a 60 day window to understand trends in stock data in order to make accurate predictions. Test loss for the final tuned model was 0.0004611943440977484.
